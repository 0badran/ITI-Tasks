1. Loop and 2D Array:
Assignment: Matrix Multiplication
Implement a C# program that multiplies two matrices. Take two 2D arrays as input, perform the multiplication, and display the result. Use nested loops to iterate through the matrices.

2. Loop and Jagged Array:
Assignment: Find Maximum in Jagged Array
Create a jagged array (an array of arrays) of integers. Write a C# program to find and display the maximum value in each sub-array. Use nested loops to iterate through the jagged array.

3. Loop, 1D, and 2D Arrays:
Assignment: Matrix Transposition
Write a C# program that transposes a given matrix. Take a 2D array as input and produce its transpose as output. Transposing a matrix involves swapping its rows and columns.

4. Loop, 1D, 2D Arrays, and Jagged Array:
Assignment: Search in Jagged Array
Create a jagged array of strings where each element is an array of words. Implement a C# program to search for a specific word in the jagged array. Display the indices where the word is found.
